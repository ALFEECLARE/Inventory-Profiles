## Updating Fabric

For the official launcher make sure you don't have the game or the launcher running and follow [this guide](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/player:tutorials:install_mcl:windows)

For the other launchers... really you should know how to do it :)

## Known issues

- Anchor hearer may not be shown correctly if the UI scaling is more than 2 or if the game windows is too small
